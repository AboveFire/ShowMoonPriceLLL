Show moon prices and risk rating in moons menu

## Info

This mod is compatible with modded moons which are using LethalLevelLoader. It will not break when using LethalExpansionCore moons, but will show them costing 0$. I don't Intend to fix this since I don't want to depend on LethalExpansionCore.

This mod is most likely not compatible with mods changing the value of vanilla moons. If they are changed within LethalLevelLoader it will work.

## Changelogs
